Instructions for generating ALIGO transfer functions

Navigate to aligocalibration SVN. My copy of this repo can
be found at LHO: /home/daniel.finstad/src/aligocalibration/

Navigate to tf-generating script for desired IFO (relative
to the SVN path):
L1: trunk/Runs/O2/L1/Scripts/DARMOLGTFs/acd_tfs.m
H1: trunk/Runs/O2/H1/Scripts/DARMOLGTFs/acd_tfs_h1.m

Edit script to set IFOparams to desired reference
measurement file. These can be found at:

trunk/Runs/O2/IFO/params/MEASUREMENT_DATE/modelparams*.conf

where IFO is either H1 or L1, and MEASUREMENT_DATE is the
date the reference measurements were taken

Start matlab, execute script
